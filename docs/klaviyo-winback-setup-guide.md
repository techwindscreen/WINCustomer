# Klaviyo Winback Email Campaign Setup Guide

This guide shows you how to set up the permanent magic link winback email campaign in Klaviyo.

## ðŸ“§ Email Templates Created

1. **klaviyo-winback-quote-ready-template.html** - Main HTML template for first winback email
2. **klaviyo-winback-quote-ready-text.txt** - Text version for better deliverability
3. **klaviyo-winback-follow-up-template.html** - Follow-up email for continued winback

## ðŸ”§ Klaviyo Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create the Flow

1. Go to Klaviyo Dashboard â†’ Flows â†’ Create Flow
2. Choose "Create from Scratch"
3. Name it: "Windscreen Quote Winback Campaign"

### Step 2: Set the Trigger

**Trigger:** Custom Event
- Event Name: `Quote Completed` (this is already triggered when customers submit contact info)
- Wait for: 2 hours (to allow for immediate payments)

### Step 3: Add Filter

Add a conditional filter:
- **If/Else Split:** Check if customer has made a payment
- **Condition:** `payment_status` not equals `paid`
- **Yes Branch:** Continue with winback emails
- **No Branch:** End flow (customer already paid)

### Step 4: Create Email Sequence

#### Email 1: Quote Ready (Send after 2 hours)
- **Subject:** "Your Windscreen Quote is Ready - Complete Your Booking"
- **Template:** Use `klaviyo-winback-quote-ready-template.html`
- **Timing:** 2 hours after quote completion

#### Email 2: Follow-up (Send after 3 days)
- **Subject:** "Still Interested? Your Quote is Waiting"
- **Template:** Use `klaviyo-winback-follow-up-template.html`
- **Timing:** 3 days after Email 1
- **Add Filter:** Only send if still not paid

#### Email 3: Final Reminder (Send after 7 days)
- **Subject:** "Last Chance - Don't Miss Out on Your Quote"
- **Template:** Modify the follow-up template with more urgency
- **Timing:** 7 days after Email 2
- **Add Filter:** Only send if still not paid

## ðŸ”— Magic Link Implementation

### The Magic Link URL
The permanent magic link is embedded in the templates as:
```html
https://quote.windscreencompare.com/api/get-permanent-link?quoteId={{ event.quote_id }}&email={{ person.email }}
```

### Required Data Variables
Make sure these variables are available in your Klaviyo events:

**Required:**
- `{{ event.quote_id }}` - The quote ID
- `{{ person.email }}` - Customer email address

**Optional (enhances personalization):**
- `{{ person.first_name }}` - Customer's first name
- `{{ event.vehicle_registration }}` - Vehicle reg number
- `{{ event.glass_type }}` - OEM or OEE
- `{{ event.total_price }}` - Total quote price
- `{{ event.deposit_amount }}` - 30% deposit amount

## ðŸ“Š Event Tracking Setup

The system automatically sends the `Quote Completed` event when customers submit contact info. The event includes:

```javascript
{
  // Customer information
  user_name: "John Smith",
  user_email: "john@example.com",
  user_phone: "+44XXXXXXXXX",
  user_location: "London",
  
  // Quote details
  quote_id: "WIN123456",
  vehicle_registration: "AB12 CDE",
  glass_type: "OEE",
  total_price: 299.99,
  
  // Pricing breakdown
  deposit_amount: 89.99
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Segmentation

### Create Segments:
1. **Unpaid Quotes** - Customers who completed quotes but haven't paid
2. **High Value Quotes** - Quotes over Â£300 (for priority follow-up)
3. **Mobile Service Customers** - For location-specific messaging

### Suggested Segments:
```
Segment: Unpaid Windscreen Quotes
